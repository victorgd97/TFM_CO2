[{"action":"Eat less meat","CO2":5130, "description":"If everyone in the world ate red meat just once a week (flexitarian), we could save about 5,130 Gt C02eq. However, not every country consumes meat the same. If this figure is weighted towards those who consume more meat, by just looking at the top 20 countries, we can account for more than 75% of this amount."},
{"action":"Reduce all transport emissions by 20%","CO2":9452, "description":"Transport emissions are one of the largest contributors. Although this is largely attributed to private cars and freight, if we could shift choices towards more public transport, more efficient vehicles and less distance travelled, there could be a  significant drop in carbon added to the atmosphere."},
{"action":"Increase renewable energy","CO2":467, "description":"Two thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the production and use of energy. In 2015, just 16% of the worldâ€™s energy supply came from solar, wind and other renewable sources. If we can get that figure up to 65% by 2050 - a shift that researchers say is both technically and financially feasible - then we can prevent 14,000 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions"}

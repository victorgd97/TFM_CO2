An environmentally friendly alternative is artificial meat, which appeared in the early 2000s and referred originally to food produced from certain plants that, after transformation, would taste very similar to traditional meat. Today, however, ‘artificial meat’ increasingly refers to meat produced by a new process, in which the meat is prepared from the stem cells of real meat from living animals. In comparison to conventionally produced European meat, cultured meat involves approximately 78-96 % lower GHG emissions. Taking into account the less emission reduction (78%), if a half of the industries change their production methods from livestock farming to this emerging technology we could save about 2,769 Mt CO2eq per year.","amount_all":"2769","amount_some":"","amount_some_desc":"Half of the industries change their production methods from livestock farming to artificial meat.","source":"Source: Artificial meat","icon":"meat","title":""}]

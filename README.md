This project was designed and developed in the [Master’s program in Visual Tools to Empower Citizens (MVTEC)](http://www.mastervisualtoolsudg.com/) organized by [Fundació UdG](https://www.fundacioudg.org/) and the [ViT Foundation](https://www.fundaciovit.org/).

## Introduction 
The project “HIGHWAY TO #CO2 HELL”  touches on the overarching theme of the climate crises and its mitigation,  to be presented to an audience who is not necessarily familiar with the subject.  

The precise focus is to visualize that CO2 emissions are reaching the safe limit.  
Key messages we want to transmit  are:
1. If we do nothing the crisis does not stop,
2. We need to focus on how to extend the margin we have left,
3. We can not only blame citizens,
4. We are dealing with uncertainty.  

We are essentially displaying the magnitude of global CO2 anthropogenic emissions for the past, present and future. The magnitudes are shown using the carbon budget concept. This concept stems from  the relationship (approximately linear)  between anthropogenic emissions and global warming- what is known as the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions.  

A focus is placed on showing accountability/responsibility  for the emissions, that is: who has been and is emitting and how in past and present,  as well as who should be acting to reduce the emissions and how in the present and future.  

We achieve this with 3 conceptual parts:
- **Budget**: it shows the historical accumulation of emissions and  takes you to the present situation. It provides background. It establishes a sense of urgency.

- **Partition**: it  shows the different ways accounting  of emissions is done and the elements included. It expands the background. It explores responsibility.

- **Action**: it shows example mitigation actions that can be taken by different society actors. It provides a way of seeing the relative impact of the efforts at different layers. It prompts action and will to get informed.

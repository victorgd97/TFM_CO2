This project was designed and developed in the [Master’s program in Visual Tools to Empower Citizens (MVTEC)](http://www.mastervisualtoolsudg.com/) organized by [Fundació UdG](https://www.fundacioudg.org/) and the [ViT Foundation](https://www.fundaciovit.org/).

## Introduction 
The project “HIGHWAY TO #CO2 HELL”  touches on the overarching theme of the climate crises and its mitigation, to be presented to an audience who is not necessarily familiar with the subject.  

The precise focus is to visualize that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are reaching the safe limit.  
Key messages we want to transmit  are:
1. If we do nothing the crisis does not stop,
2. We need to focus on how to extend the margin we have left,
3. We can not only blame citizens,
4. We are dealing with uncertainty.  

We are essentially displaying the magnitude of global CO<sub>2</sub> anthropogenic emissions for the past, present and future. The magnitudes are shown using the carbon budget concept. This concept stems from  the relationship (approximately linear)  between anthropogenic emissions and global warming- what is known as the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions.  

A focus is placed on showing accountability/responsibility  for the emissions, that is: who has been and is emitting and how in past and present, as well as who should be acting to reduce the emissions and how in the present and future.  

We achieve this with 3 conceptual parts:
- **Budget**: it shows the historical accumulation of emissions and  takes you to the present situation. It provides background. It establishes a sense of urgency.

- **Partition**: it  shows the different ways accounting of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is done and the elements included. It expands the background. It explores responsibility.

- **Action**: it shows example mitigation actions that can be taken by different society actors. It provides a way of seeing the relative impact of the efforts at different layers. It prompts action and will to get informed.

## Data source and ethical considerations 
A first approach to the subject was done with a [time series of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions national](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions) data provided by Our World in Data (OWID). Thereafter, we search for complementary data along two main types of data flows: the accounting of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and the estimations of reduction magnitudes for the action items.  
##### Accounting of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
The reference document for this part was the report for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from 2018 [Global Warming of 1.5°C](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) and in particular the  section  about “The Remaining 1.5°C Carbon Budget”.  This was supporting the decision on what data to use for the historical time series,  the magnitude of the remaining budget and the related uncertainty.  Accordingly, the OWID  data we had (which only accounted for contributions from fossil fuels combustion and industry)  was complemented with data from  [Global Carbon Project](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/), (the original source for OWID) to add emissions from land-use change.
For the breakdown of the direct emissions we used the original data per country. For the breakdown [per sectors](https://ourworldindata.org/ghg-emissions-by-sector) we used data from OWID. 
In all cases data was open, free, and obtained by direct on-line download from the provider. The provider is either the primary generator of the data or refers to it. 
##### Actions data for reducing emissions
We wanted to get a good range of options - from those circulating in the public space to more scientifically proven ones that might be lesser known. To do this, we had to get the data from a variety of sources, listed below.

- [Food waste][1]: Extracted from the Food wastage footprint & Climate Change report from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
- [Eat less meat][2]: Taken from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. 
- [Reduce transport emissions][3]: Climate Watch historical data on Greenhouse gas emissions.
- [Increase renewable energy][4]: International Renewable Energy Agency 2017 report.
- [Restore and protect forests and wetlands][5]: Sectoral greenhouse gas emission reduction potential in 2030 by UNEP report.
- [Build our cities more sustainably][6]: The New Climate Economy report
- [Reduce industry emissions][7]: Climate Accountability's carbon majors report from 2020 
- [Sustainable fast fashion][8]: Clothes and Climate change report from Group Against Smog and Pollution (GASP) .
- [More artificial meat][9]: Artificial Meat and the environment report from the European Environment Agency (EEA).

##### General ethical considerations. 
We are dealing with data coming from monitoring and estimations of a complicated nature that is being distilled for us by their providers. We decided to trust only sources that can be reliable (scientifically backed-up), authoritative (widely accepted) and/or neutral (no private agendas). 
This ensures data quality, transparency, and avoids bias.  Transparency is kept by further reporting and linking the data sources, which also adds to fairness (acknowledging the data gathering effort). 
Another big ethical chapter is that of avoiding bias during usage and interpretation of the data. This is best avoided by making oneself knowledgeable on the subject. Also, by presenting the data in as neutral a way as possible.

## Data processing and analysis

Here we detail both numerical processing and decision-making steps.

##### Accounting of CO2 emissions, remaining budget, uncertainty:  

- **Historical time series 1750-2017**, in Gt CO<sub>2</sub> is the sum of
	Owid data per year, Mt CO<sub>2</sub> →  global Gt CO<sub>2</sub>, via sum and unit change
	GCP  global land-use data per year,  Gt C → global Gt CO<sub>2</sub>, via unit change
- **Historical time series 2017 onwards** including baseline for future emissions  is  a constant that equals the level  of emissions at 2017. We chose to stop at 2017 to be consistent with the calculations of the remaining C budget, even if it is known that emission increased yearly. 
- **Magnitude of the remaining carbon budget** is taken straight from the IPCC report, defined as “cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the start of 2018 until the time of net zero global emissions for global warming defined as a change in global near-surface air temperatures” and using the 1.5 °C limit. The  TCRE (the slope between the CO<sub>2</sub> and the warming,  see e.g. [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1368-z)) is in itself an estimation surrounded by uncertainty (1.65 +- 0.85 stdev, 0.2–0.7 °C per 1 000 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>). If we use the range of slopes that falls into the 50-67 percentile, at the intersection of 1.5 °C this corresponds to  a remaining C budget of 420-580 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>. A proper representation of the uncertainty would need to include the  probability distribution of the values inside the range. [Here](https://observablehq.com/@nuriaaltimir/uncertaity-if-the-remaing-1-5-carbon-budget) there is an exercise assuming normality. As we can not infer normality, we would need to study the behaviour further. This level of detail was not deemed necessary for the message, we decided to use just a range or 160Gt (= 580-450) to give a sense of magnitude.  In reality, there are more factors bringing uncertainty to the estimates of the remaining C budget, see summary e.g. in Fig 1 [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-020-00663-3).
- The **target year** we are giving is 2040, which is in the middle range of the estimations. For the sake of  implementation simplicity we did not consider showing the uncertainty around this number.
